# Practice Problem 1

A legislature is working on a public works bill which will affect the level of spending on highway construction and on public transportation projects. There are 3 groups on this issue A, B and C. The members of each group have preferences identical to each other, but different from other groups. Ideal points for each group are indicated on the diagram. Everyone has Euclidean preferences.

Is the policy outcome a Condorcet winner?
