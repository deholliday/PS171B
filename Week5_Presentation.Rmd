# Real World Example: Quadratic Voting

.pull-left[
Voting rule is the same (SMR), which is typically one person, one vote. But do all votes mean the same amount to each person? **Quadratic Voting** accounts for variance in preference intensity by allowing voters to "buy" more votes, but at a cost.

For example, Democrats in Colorado won majorities in both houses and the governorship and needed to determine spending priorities. Each legislator was given 100 chips to "spend" on votes. 1 vote cost 1 chip, 2 votes cost 4, 3 cost 9... all the way up to 10 votes costing all 100 chips.

# Spatial Model Basics

Alternatives are a matter of degree, and we can represent utilities over alternatives as points on a line.

## Practice:

Derek's at the bar (again) explaining his theory of the utility of beer as a function of how light/dark it is to his roommates, Kevin and Julian. The three have the following preference orderings over lightness/darkness:

```{r, echo=F, warning = F}
library(kableExtra)
df = data.frame(Derek = c("Dark","Light","Amber"),
                Kevin = c("Amber","Dark","Light"),
                Julian = c("Light","Amber","Dark"))
kable(df, type = "html")
```

Assume the x-axis is a continuous scale of lightness/darkness and the y-axis is the utility of x. Draw a figure such that the above preference orderings are represented spatially.

# Single-Peaked Preferences

For each person, there is a single "ideal" point and utility decreases as choices get farther from it.

Violations:

- Non-quantifiable issues

- Multiple peaks

Black's Theorem: given SPP and three available alternatives, all people agree that the middle one will never be worst (could be best or middle). If we further assume a single dimension, there is always a Condorcet winner (Median Voter Theorem).

Does SPP violate any of Arrow's axioms?

# Symmetric Preferences

Our preferences are just as sensitive to outcome being to low as too high (more formally, the loss of utility for any move $x$ away from ideal point is the same).

Alternatives:

- Asymmetric Preferences

- Euclidian preferences (subset)

Symmetry allows us to draw preferences as points on a line.
