# Review of Preference Notation

Strict Preference:

$x \succ y$ or $xPy$

Weak Preference:

$x \succeq y$ or $xRy$

Indifference:

$x \sim y$ or $xIy$

# Review of Rationality

Preference orderings must be **complete** and **transitive** in order to be rational.

- **Completeness**: $\forall x \in X$ and $\forall y \in X$, either $xRy$ or $yRx$

- **Transitivity**:  $\forall x \in X$, $\forall y \in X$, and $\forall z \in X$ if $xRy$ and $yRz$ then $xRz$

Usually we don't have issues with completeness. When might preferences be intransitive?

# Practice Problem (Shepsle 2.4)

Two actors hold the following preferences over outcomes $w, \ x, \ y,$ and $z$:

- Mr. $i$: $xPw, \ xPy, \ zPx, \ yPz, \ wPy,$ and $wPz$

- Ms. $j$: $xIy, \ xPz, \ xPw, \ yPz, \ yPw,$ and $wIz$

When presented with a choice over any subset of 3 or more outcomes...

- For which subsets can the actor identify their most-preferred choice(s)?

- Do any of the subsets contain a preference intransitivity among all outcomes in the subset?
